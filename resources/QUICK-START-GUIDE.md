## ‚ö° Critical Success Factors

### DO:
‚úÖ Focus on UX (25% of score, biggest differentiator)
‚úÖ Ship working MVP by Oct 23 (buffer for polish)
‚úÖ Integrate at least ONE real API (shows feasibility)
‚úÖ Make compelling demo video (first impression!)
‚úÖ Test redemption flow thoroughly (core innovation)
‚úÖ Submit 24-48h early (avoid last-minute issues)

### DON'T:
‚ùå Over-engineer (working product > perfect code)
‚ùå Ignore mobile (90% of deal discovery is mobile)
‚ùå Skimp on demo video (judges see this first)
‚ùå Use crypto jargon in UI (abstract Web3 completely)
‚ùå Build token economics (unnecessary complexity)
‚ùå Wait until last day to submit (RISKY!)

## üí∞ ROI Analysis

**Investment:**

- Money: $50-300 (optional: paid APIs, RPC, hosting)

**Potential Return:**
- 1st: $5,000 + 3 NFTs (likely $1000+ value)

## üß† Strategic Insights

### Why This is Winnable
1. **0 current submissions** = first-mover advantage
2. **Clear requirements** = no ambiguity, easier execution
3. **RECTOR's skills** = full-stack + blockchain (perfect match)
4. **14 days timeline** = sufficient with focused execution
5. **Real utility** = judges love practical Web3 applications

### Where Competitors Will Fail
1. **Poor UX** - Most will have crypto-native jargon (you won't)
2. **Incomplete** - Many will skip redemption flow (you won't)
3. **No real data** - They'll use dummy data (you'll have API)
4. **Bad demos** - Rushed videos (you'll plan ahead)

### Your Competitive Edges
- **UX abstraction** (email login, no crypto jargon)
- **Real API integration** (live deals, not mocks)
- **Social features** (viral growth potential)
- **Complete product** (all core + bonus features)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Smart contract bugs | Use audited Metaplex templates, extensive testing |
| Time underestimation | Buffer days in timeline, cut features if needed |
| Scope creep | Strict MVP definition, ruthless prioritization |
| API failures | Mock data fallback, error handling |
| Poor demo video | Script ahead, practice, record early |

**Checkpoint Strategy:**
- End of Day 3: Are contracts working?
- End of Day 8: Does end-to-end flow work?
- End of Day 11: Is it submission-ready?

If behind at any checkpoint ‚Üí cut bonus features, focus on core.
