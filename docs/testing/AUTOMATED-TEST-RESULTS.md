# Automated Testing Results - Manual Test Guide

**Test Date:** 2025-10-19
**Tester:** Claude Code (Automated via Playwright + Supabase MCP)
**Environment:** localhost:3000 (Development)
**Browser:** Playwright Chromium

---

## Testing Limitations

**CRITICAL LIMITATION**: Playwright cannot programmatically interact with browser wallet extensions (Phantom/Solflare). Tests requiring wallet signatures (claiming deals, staking, redeeming) cannot be fully automated without:
1. Mock wallet adapter for testing, or
2. Manual intervention for wallet approvals

**Automated Testing Scope:**
- ‚úÖ UI rendering and navigation
- ‚úÖ Page loads and routing
- ‚úÖ Guest user features
- ‚úÖ Database queries via Supabase MCP
- ‚úÖ Visual regression testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Wallet connection UI (cannot approve in extension)
- ‚ùå BLOCKED: Blockchain transactions (mint, burn, stake)

---

## Test Results

### Test 1: Connect Wallet (Solana Wallet Adapter)

**Status:** ‚úÖ PASS (UI only - connection approval blocked by extension)

**Steps Tested:**
1. ‚úÖ Visit homepage - loaded successfully
2. ‚úÖ Click "Select Wallet" button - modal opens
3. ‚úÖ Wallet list displayed - Phantom detected with "Detected" badge
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED: Cannot approve connection in browser extension
5. ‚úÖ Disconnect flow tested - wallet disconnects correctly
6. ‚úÖ UI state changes verified:
   - Connected: Shows wallet address (2jLo..MaLk)
   - Disconnected: Shows "Select Wallet" button
   - Navigation appears/disappears based on connection state

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Wallet connection modal appears
- ‚úÖ Wallet list shows Phantom + Solflare
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Connection approved in wallet - NOT TESTABLE VIA PLAYWRIGHT
- ‚úÖ Header shows connected wallet address when connected
- ‚úÖ Navigation expands to show: Marketplace, My Coupons, Profile

**Bugs/Issues Found:**
```
NONE - UI behavior correct. Wallet extension interaction cannot be automated.
```

**Screenshots:**
- `test-01-homepage.png` - Homepage loaded

**Steps Tested:**
1. ‚úÖ Stayed on homepage (logged in not required)
2. ‚úÖ Checked browser console for errors
3. ‚úÖ Verified Solana configuration in .env.local
4. ‚úÖ Verified no RPC errors

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ Program ID visible in config: `RECcAGSNVfAdGeTsR92jMUM2DBuedSqpAn9W8pNrLi7`
- ‚úÖ RPC Endpoint configured: https://api.devnet.solana.com

**Bugs/Issues Found:**
```
NONE
```

---

### Test 3: Access Merchant Dashboard

**Status:** ‚úÖ PASS (Redirect behavior verified - full merchant flow requires wallet)

**Steps Tested:**
1. ‚úÖ Visited `/dashboard` without authentication
2. ‚úÖ Verified redirect to homepage
3. ‚úÖ Console log confirmed: "Not signed in, redirecting to home..."

**Expected Results:**

- ‚ùå Navigation shows dashboard link - Not visible (unauthenticated state)

**Bugs/Issues Found:**
```
NONE - Redirect behavior correct for unauthenticated users.
```

**Note:** Full merchant dashboard functionality requires wallet connection and merchant registration, which cannot be automated via Playwright.

---

### Test 4: Create a Test Deal (Merchant Only)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED (Requires wallet connection + merchant registration)

**Reason:** Full merchant dashboard functionality requires wallet connection and merchant registration, which cannot be automated via Playwright without manual wallet approval.

---

### Test 5: Browse Marketplace as Logged-In User

**Reason:** Minting NFTs requires wallet signature approval, which cannot be automated via Playwright.

---

### Test 8: Generate QR Code

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED (Requires NFT ownership from Test 7)

**Reason:** Cannot test QR code generation without first claiming a deal (Test 7 blocked).

---

### Test 9: Redeem Coupon (Merchant View)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED (Requires QR code from Test 8)

**Reason:** Cannot test redemption flow without QR code from claimed deal.

- ‚úÖ Score updates in real-time
- ‚úÖ Active state shows on selected vote
- ‚úÖ No errors in console

**Bugs/Issues Found:**
```
üêõ CRITICAL BUG: Database constraint violation on vote submission

Error Code: 23514
Error Message: "new row for relation 'votes' violates check constraint 'votes_vote_type_check'"

Root Cause:
- Database schema only accepts 'up' or 'down' as vote_type values
- Frontend component sent 'upvote' or 'downvote'
- API route did not normalize between formats

Fix Implemented:
- Modified /app/api/votes/route.ts (Lines 18-29, 92, 149-160)
- Added vote type normalization layer:
  * Frontend ‚Üí API: Accepts 'upvote'/'downvote' or 'up'/'down'
  * API ‚Üí Database: Normalizes to 'up'/'down' before insertion
  * Database ‚Üí Frontend: Converts back to 'upvote'/'downvote' in GET response
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Prevents future schema mismatches

Files Modified:
- src/frontend/app/api/votes/route.ts (normalization logic)

Verification:
‚úÖ Upvote successful (score: 0 ‚Üí +1)
‚úÖ Button state correct (green when active)
‚úÖ No console errors
‚úÖ Database INSERT successful
‚úÖ Server response: 200 OK
```

## Critical Bug Report

### Bug #1: Vote Type Database Constraint Violation

**Severity:** CRITICAL (P0)
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Found In:** Test 11 (Vote on Deals)
**Date:** 2025-10-19

**Description:**
Voting system failed with HTTP 500 error when users attempted to upvote or downvote deals. Database rejected all vote submissions due to CHECK constraint violation.

**Technical Details:**
- Database constraint: `votes_vote_type_check` only allows `['up', 'down']`
- Frontend sent: `'upvote'`, `'downvote'`
- No normalization layer in API route

**Impact:**
- 100% of vote submissions failed
- Users could not vote on any deals
- Core social feature completely broken

**Fix:**
Implemented three-layer vote type normalization pattern in `/app/api/votes/route.ts`:

1. **POST endpoint normalization** (Lines 18-29):
   ```typescript
   let normalizedVoteType: 'up' | 'down';
   if (vote_type === 'upvote' || vote_type === 'up') {
     normalizedVoteType = 'up';
   } else if (vote_type === 'downvote' || vote_type === 'down') {
     normalizedVoteType = 'down';
   } else {
     return NextResponse.json(
       { error: 'vote_type must be "upvote" or "downvote"' },
       { status: 400 }
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Database operations** (Lines 41, 65, 92, 149):
   - Use `normalizedVoteType` ('up'/'down') for all database queries and inserts

3. **GET endpoint response normalization** (Lines 154-160):
   ```typescript
   if (userVoteData) {
     userVote = userVoteData.vote_type === 'up' ? 'upvote' : 'downvote';
   }
   ```

**Testing:**
- ‚úÖ Verified upvote creates database record with 'up'
- ‚úÖ Verified score calculation works (0 ‚Üí +1)
- ‚úÖ Verified button UI state updates correctly
- ‚úÖ Verified GET endpoint returns 'upvote'/'downvote' to frontend
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ No server errors (200 OK response)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/frontend/app/api/votes/route.ts` (4 sections modified)

## Testing Limitations Discovered

**Playwright MCP Capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ **CAN TEST**: UI rendering, navigation, page loads, database queries
- ‚úÖ **CAN CONNECT WALLET**: When Phantom wallet was previously authorized in browser (auto-reconnect)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CANNOT TEST**: Wallet signature approvals (transactions blocked at extension level)
- ‚ùå **CANNOT TEST**: Blockchain transactions (mint, burn, stake, transfer)

**Tests Requiring Manual Execution:**
- Tests 4, 7-9, 12-27 (16 total tests)
- All require either:
  - Wallet signature approval (Phantom/Solflare extension)
  - NFT ownership from previous test
  - Blockchain state changes

**Recommendation:**
Consider implementing `@solana/wallet-adapter-mock` for automated blockchain transaction testing in CI/CD pipeline.

---

**Notes:**
- Automated testing EXCELLENT for catching integration bugs (vote normalization)
- Playwright MCP + Supabase MCP combination highly effective for E2E testing
- Database schema inspection via Supabase MCP crucial for debugging
- 1 critical production bug found and fixed during testing session
- Manual testing still required for blockchain transaction flows
