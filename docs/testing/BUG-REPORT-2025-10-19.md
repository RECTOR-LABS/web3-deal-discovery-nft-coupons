# Bug Report - 2025-10-19
## Playwright Testing Session - Wallet Integration

**Testing Context:**
- Platform: Playwright automated browser testing
- Wallet: Phantom (already installed in Playwright)
- Test Flow: Homepage → Connect Wallet → Test Voting Feature

---

## Bug #1: Wallet Disconnects on Page Navigation

### Severity: 🔴 **CRITICAL**

### Description:
Wallet connection does not persist across page navigations. After connecting Phantom wallet on homepage, navigating to any other page causes wallet to disconnect.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open homepage (http://localhost:3000)
2. Click "Select Wallet" button
3. Select "Phantom" (shows as "Detected")
4. Click "Connect" button TWICE (Playwright quirk)
5. Verify wallet connected - shows "2jLo..MaLk" in header
6. Navigate to any other page (e.g., click a deal card)
7. **BUG:** Wallet button now shows "Connect" instead of wallet address

### Expected Behavior:
Wallet should remain connected across all pages once authenticated.

### Actual Behavior:
Wallet disconnects on every page navigation, requiring re-connection.

### Root Cause:
**File:** `src/frontend/components/shared/WalletProvider.tsx:28`

```typescript
<WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect={false}>
```

The `autoConnect={false}` setting prevents wallet from automatically reconnecting on page load.

### Fix:
Change line 28 to:
```typescript
<WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect={true}>
```

Or simply remove the prop (true is default):
```typescript
<WalletProvider wallets={wallets}>
```

### Impact:
- **User Experience:** SEVERE - Users must reconnect wallet on every page
- **Feature Broken:** My Coupons, Profile, Staking, Voting, Deal Claiming
- **Conversion Rate:** HIGH NEGATIVE - Users will abandon flow

## Bug #2: Vote Button Triggers Parent Link Navigation

### Severity: 🟡 **HIGH**

### Description:
Clicking upvote/downvote buttons on homepage deal cards triggers navigation to deal detail page instead of submitting vote. This causes the vote API request to be cancelled mid-flight.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect Phantom wallet on homepage
2. Locate any deal card with vote buttons
3. Click "Upvote" button
4. **BUG:** Page navigates to deal detail instead of submitting vote
5. Console shows: `Error submitting vote: TypeError: Failed to fetch`
6. Vote is NOT recorded in database

### Expected Behavior:
- Click upvote → Vote submitted → Score updates → Stay on current page
- Click deal card (outside buttons) → Navigate to detail page

### Actual Behavior:
- Click upvote → Page navigates → Vote request cancelled → Error in console

### Root Cause:
**File:** `src/frontend/app/page.tsx` (lines 326-336, 357-367)

Vote buttons are nested inside Link component:
```tsx
<Link href={`/marketplace/${deal.id}`}>  {/* Parent link */}
  <DealCard deal={deal}>
    <VoteButtons dealId={deal.id} />  {/* Child buttons */}
  </DealCard>
</Link>
```

When clicking vote button:
1. Button triggers POST `/api/votes`
2. Click event bubbles up to parent `<Link>`
3. Page navigation cancels in-flight POST request
4. Fetch throws "Failed to fetch" error

**File:** `src/frontend/components/user/VoteButtons.tsx:240-261`

Missing `event.stopPropagation()` in button click handler:

```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => handleVote('upvote')}  // ❌ No event.stopPropagation()
  disabled={!publicKey || submitting}
  title="Upvote"
>
```

### Fix:
Add `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent click event from bubbling:

```typescript
<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();  // ✅ Stop event bubbling
    handleVote('upvote');
  }}
  disabled={!publicKey || submitting}
  title="Upvote"
>
```

Apply same fix to downvote button.

### Impact:
- **Feature Broken:** Voting completely non-functional on homepage
- **Database:** No votes being recorded
- **Epic 6 (Social Layer):** 50% broken - voting is core feature
- **Judging Criteria:** Will lose points for broken social features

---

## Testing Environment

**Browser:** Playwright Chromium
**Wallet:** Phantom (pre-installed extension)
**Node.js:** Latest
**Dev Server:** http://localhost:3000 (running)

---

## Console Errors Observed

### During Vote Button Click:
```
[ERROR] Error submitting vote: TypeError: Failed to fetch
    at handleVote (webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./components/user/VoteButtons.tsx:183:36)
```

### Expected Console Logs (Normal):
```
GET /.identity 404          // Wallet adapter detection (harmless)
POST /current-url 404       // Wallet adapter communication (harmless)
GET /api/votes?deal_id=...  // Vote stats fetch (working)
```

---

## Screenshots

1. **Wallet Connected (Before Bug):**
   - `.screenshot/playwright-wallet-connected-success.png`
   - Shows: "Phantom icon 2jLo..MaLk" in header
   - Vote buttons: Enabled (green)

2. **Wallet Disconnected (After Navigation):**
   - `.screenshot/playwright-wallet-disconnected-after-navigation.png`
   - Shows: "Connect" button in header
   - Vote buttons: Disabled (gray)

---

## Priority & Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Submission):
1. **Fix Bug #1** - Change `autoConnect={true}` in WalletProvider.tsx
2. **Fix Bug #2** - Add `e.stopPropagation()` to VoteButtons.tsx
3. **Retest** - Verify both fixes work in Playwright
4. **Regression Test** - Ensure fixes don't break other features

### Testing Checklist:
- [x] Bug #1 Fix: Wallet persists across all pages ✅ **FIXED & VERIFIED**
- [x] Bug #2 Fix: Vote buttons work without navigation ✅ **FIXED & VERIFIED**
- [ ] Marketplace page: Voting works (blocked by database issue)
- [ ] Deal detail page: Voting works (blocked by database issue)
- [ ] My Coupons page: Wallet connected
- [ ] Profile page: Wallet connected
- [ ] Staking page: Wallet connected

## Bug Fixes Applied & Verified ✅

### Bug #1 Fix - VERIFIED WORKING

**File:** `src/frontend/components/shared/WalletProvider.tsx:28`

**Change Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
<WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect={false}>

// AFTER (fixed):
<WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect={true}>
```

**Test Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS**
- Wallet automatically reconnects on page load
- Wallet address "2jLo..MaLk" persists across all page navigations
- Authenticated navigation shows: Marketplace | My Coupons | Profile

---

### Bug #2 Fix - VERIFIED WORKING

**File:** `src/frontend/components/user/VoteButtons.tsx:217-220, 255-258`

**Change Applied:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
onClick={() => handleVote('upvote')}

// AFTER (fixed):
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();      // Prevent Link default navigation
  e.stopPropagation();    // Stop event bubbling to parent Link
  handleVote('upvote');
}}
```

**Test Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS**
- Clicking upvote/downvote does NOT navigate to deal detail page
- Page stays on homepage
- Vote button click is isolated from parent Link component

**Note:** Vote API returns 500 error due to database issue (see New Issue #3 below)

## New Issue Discovered During Testing

### Issue #3: Votes Table Missing or Misconfigured in Supabase

**Severity:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** (blocks voting functionality)

**Description:**
After fixing Bug #2, vote buttons no longer trigger navigation, but vote submissions fail with 500 Internal Server Error.

**Error:**
```
POST /api/votes → 500 Internal Server Error
Alert: "Failed to create vote"
```

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
1. `votes` table doesn't exist in Supabase database, OR
2. Row Level Security (RLS) policies are blocking INSERT operations, OR
3. Schema mismatch between API and database

**Evidence:**
- CLAUDE.md documents 11 tables including `votes`
- No SQL migration files found in repository
- Vote API route expects table structure: `{ deal_id, user_wallet, vote_type }`

**Fix Required:**
1. Create `votes` table in Supabase with schema:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE votes (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
     deal_id UUID REFERENCES deals(id) NOT NULL,
     user_wallet TEXT NOT NULL,
     vote_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (vote_type IN ('upvote', 'downvote')),
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
     UNIQUE(deal_id, user_wallet)
   );
   ```

2. Add RLS policy to allow INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE for authenticated users:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE votes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON votes
     FOR SELECT USING (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to vote" ON votes
     FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update own votes" ON votes
     FOR UPDATE USING (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete own votes" ON votes
     FOR DELETE USING (true);
   ```

**Impact:**
- Epic 6 (Social Layer) partially broken - voting disabled
- Does NOT affect other features (browse, claim, staking, etc.)
- Fixable before submission

**Priority:** Fix before Epic 11 submission

## Notes

**Playwright Quirk:**
- Phantom connection requires clicking "Connect" button TWICE
- First click: Modal appears with wallet selection
- Second click: Actually initiates connection
- This is a Playwright-specific behavior, not a real bug

**Testing Approach:**
- Manual testing via Playwright MCP browser
- Real Phantom wallet extension installed
- Simulates actual user experience more accurately than Jest/RTL
