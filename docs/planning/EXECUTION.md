**Phase 1: Audit & Identify (30 min)**
- Search all .tsx files for crypto terms: NFT, mint, wallet, blockchain, token
- Create comprehensive list of replacements needed
- Identify user-facing vs developer-facing terms (don't change code/API names)

**Phase 2: Replace User-Facing UI Copy (1.5-2 hours)**
- Update page titles, headings, button labels
- Update form labels and placeholders
- Update success/error messages
- Update navigation labels
- Update help text and tooltips

**Phase 3: Test & Verify (30 min)**

- Ensure no broken terminology references

**Terminology Replacement Map:**
```
NFT → Digital Coupon, Coupon, Deal Pass
Mint → Create, Issue, Generate
Wallet → Account, My Coupons, Dashboard
Blockchain → Digital Record, Secure Ledger
Token → Coupon, Voucher, Pass
Redeem NFT → Use Coupon, Activate Deal
Claim Coupon → Get Deal, Save Deal
Connect Wallet → Sign In, Log In
Public Key → Account ID (if shown)
Transaction → Purchase, Redemption
Gas Fee → Processing Fee (if shown)
```

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive TRACK-REQUIREMENTS.md (507 lines, 10 epics)
- ✅ Created detailed TIMELINE.md (485 lines, 14-day roadmap)
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with complete project context
- ✅ Analyzed hackathon requirements (hackathon-analysis.md)

- Redemption: Hybrid off-chain verify + on-chain burn
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Solana Devnet (contracts)

**Mood:** ✅ On Track - Excellent planning complete

---

## 🚧 Blockers & Issues

**Current Blockers:** None

**Resolved Blockers:**
- [None yet]

**Potential Future Blockers:**
1. **Arweave API Key/Wallet** - Needed for metadata storage
   - Action: Sign up for Arweave, fund wallet
   - Due: Before Task 1.2.4

2. **External Deal API Selection** - Needed for Epic 5
   - Action: Research and choose one API (RapidAPI, Skyscanner, Booking.com)
   - Due: Before Day 9

3. **Privy/Dynamic API Key** - Needed for Epic 7 (Web3 abstraction)
   - Action: Sign up for Privy or Dynamic
   - Due: Before Day 9 (if implementing Epic 7)

---

## 📝 Key Decisions & Notes Log

### October 17, 2025

**Decision: Create PRD.md + EXECUTION.md**
- Reason: RECTOR's workflow requires formal planning docs (Epic → Story → Task)
- Impact: Systematic progress tracking, clear acceptance criteria for 100% working standard
- Time Investment: 40 min setup, 5-10 min/day maintenance
- Files Created: PRD.md (comprehensive requirements), EXECUTION.md (live tracker)

**Decision: Use Metaplex Token Metadata v1.1 for NFT standard**
- Reason: Industry standard, wallet compatibility, rich metadata support
- Impact: Ensures NFTs display correctly in Phantom/Solflare wallets
- Documented in: PRD.md Task 1.2.1, CLAUDE.md

**Decision: Use hybrid off-chain + on-chain redemption flow**
- Reason: Fast UX (off-chain verify) + trustless enforcement (on-chain burn)
- Impact: Better user experience without compromising security
- Documented in: PRD.md Epic 4, CLAUDE.md

---

### October 16, 2025

**Decision: Use npm as package manager**
- Reason: RECTOR's preference for JavaScript projects (from CLAUDE.md)
- Impact: Standard tooling, maximum compatibility
- Alternative: Bun (faster but less compatible)

**Decision: Target Devnet for development, optional Mainnet for submission**
- Reason: Devnet is free, Mainnet adds credibility but costs SOL
- Impact: Can decide closer to submission deadline
- Action: Deploy to Devnet first, evaluate Mainnet later

**Decision: Prioritize Epic 7 (Web3 Abstraction) if time allows**
- Reason: High impact on judging (User Experience = 25% of score)
- Impact: Major differentiator, lowers barrier to entry
- Trade-off: 13-16 hours investment vs bonus features

---

## ⚠️ Risk Monitor

**Current Risks:** None (Day 2 just started)

**Potential Risks:**

1. **Smart Contract Complexity (Medium Risk)**
   - Issue: Day 2 tasks may take longer than allocated
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Impact: Medium (delays Phase 1 completion)
   - Mitigation: Checkpoint at end of Day 3, adjust timeline if needed
   - Fallback: Simplify redemption logic (basic burn, no multi-use)

2. **Wallet Integration Browser Compatibility (Low Risk)**
   - Issue: Wallet adapter may have issues on Safari or Firefox
   - Likelihood: Low
   - Impact: Low (can test on Chrome only)
   - Mitigation: Test on multiple browsers early (Day 3)
   - Fallback: Focus on Phantom wallet + Chrome only

3. **API Rate Limits or Costs (Medium Risk)**
   - Issue: External deal APIs may hit rate limits or require paid tier
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Impact: Low (Epic 5 is "should-have")
   - Mitigation: Implement caching from day 1
   - Fallback: Use mock data or skip Epic 5

4. **Scope Creep (Medium Risk)**
   - Issue: Adding features not in PRD
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Impact: High (timeline slippage)
   - Mitigation: Refer to PRD for task scope, stick to acceptance criteria
   - Fallback: TIMELINE.md has checkpoint decision points (cut features)

5. **Demo Video Quality (Low Risk)**
   - Issue: Poor video production or unclear demo
   - Likelihood: Low
   - Impact: High (first impression for judges)
   - Mitigation: Record early (Day 12-13), allow time for retakes
   - Fallback: Simple screen recording with clear narration

---

### ⏳ Checkpoint 2: Phase 2 Complete (End of Day 8 - Oct 23)

**Question:** Does end-to-end flow work (mint → purchase → redeem)?

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started (Target: Oct 23)

**Target Evidence:**
- [ ] Merchant can create deals that mint NFT coupons
- [ ] User can browse and purchase coupons
- [ ] User can generate QR and merchant can redeem
- [ ] All 4 critical epics working end-to-end (Epics 1-4)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive UI

**Success Criteria:**
- Full user journey: Discover deal → Purchase → Receive NFT → Redeem → Burn
- Full merchant journey: Create deal → Mint NFT → View analytics → Scan QR → Confirm redemption
- All critical features functional (no critical bugs)

**Decision Point:**
- **If PASS:** → Proceed to Phase 3 (Differentiation features)
- **If FAIL:** → Cut Epic 5, 6, 7, 8-10; focus on polishing MVP + submission

**Risk Assessment:**
- This is the most critical checkpoint
- If Phase 2 falls behind, differentiation features must be cut
- MVP alone is competitive if polished well

---

### ⏳ Checkpoint 3: Phase 3 Complete (End of Day 11 - Oct 26)

**Question:** Is the project submission-ready (all must-haves working)?

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started (Target: Oct 26)

**Target Evidence:**
- [ ] All critical features polished (Epics 1-4)
- [ ] At least ONE differentiator implemented (Epic 5 or 6)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Professional UI/UX

**Success Criteria:**
- MVP working 100%
- At least one of: API integration (Epic 5), Social features (Epic 6), or Web3 abstraction (Epic 7)
- Code cleaned up and documented
- Ready for demo video recording

**Decision Point:**
- **If PASS:** → Proceed to submission prep (Epic 11)
- **If FAIL:** → Submit MVP + great demo video (may still be competitive)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Medium confidence - depends on Phase 2 checkpoint
- Differentiators add value but not required for submission
- Focus on polish and demo quality if features incomplete

---

### ⏳ Checkpoint 4: Submission Ready (Oct 27)

**Question:** Can you submit a working product?

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started (Target: Oct 27)

**Target Evidence:**
- [ ] Live demo deployed (Vercel + Solana)
- [ ] GitHub repo clean and documented
- [ ] Demo video recorded (3-5 min)
- [ ] All submission materials ready (README, write-up, video)

**Decision Point:**
- **If PASS:** → Submit 24-48h early (Oct 28-29)
- **If FAIL:** → Assess viability, fix critical issues, submit by deadline

**Buffer:** 2 days (Oct 28-30) for final polish and emergency fixes
