---

## Pre-Recording Setup

### Required Wallets

1. **Merchant Wallet**

     - Connect wallet
     - Fill merchant profile (business name, description, location)
     - Submit registration

   - **Why:** Registration form is boring - save video time for features!

2. **User Wallet**
   - Used for: Browsing, claiming coupons, generating QR codes
   - Needs: SOL for transactions
   - Example: Phantom wallet #2 or Solflare
   - **No registration needed** - users can browse as guests

## Recording Flow (Start to Finish)

### SEGMENT 1: Intro (40 seconds)

**What to Record:**
- Option A: You on camera introducing the project
- Option B: Screen with title slide

**Script:**
"Hi, I'm [Name]. Traditional platforms like Groupon trap your coupons in their walled gardens - you can't transfer them, trade them, or gift them. What if discounts were liquid assets you could own, trade, or resell? I built a Web3 deal discovery platform where every discount is a transferable NFT on Solana. Let me show you how it works."
