## Pro Tips for Success

### Content

- **Hook viewers in first 10 seconds** - "Imagine Groupon, but Web3 and user-owned..."
- **Show, don't tell** - More screen time, less talking
- **Highlight Web3 benefits** - Transferable, transparent, liquid
- **Emphasize real integrations** - RapidAPI, Arweave, MoonPay (not just mockups)

### Presentation

- **Speak clearly and enthusiastically** - You're selling the product!
- **Moderate pace** - Not too fast, not too slow
- **Avoid filler words** - "Um", "like", "you know"
- **Smile in your voice** - Even voiceover-only videos

### Technical Quality

- **Good audio > video quality** - Judges will tolerate 720p but not bad audio
- **Stable recording** - No shaky screen, smooth mouse movements
- **Professional polish** - Intro/outro, music, text overlays

### Strategic

- **Target 4 minutes exactly** - Shows planning, respects judges' time
- **End with strong CTA** - "Try the live demo at [URL]"
- **Include URLs on screen** - Not just voiceover (easier to copy)
- **Submit 24-48h early** - Buffer for technical issues

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Too long** - Judges lose attention after 5 minutes
‚ùå **No structure** - Rambling without clear sections
‚ùå **Poor audio** - Background noise, echo, low volume
‚ùå **Too much talking** - Show the product, not just slides
‚ùå **Skipping practice** - First take is rarely best
‚ùå **Last-minute submission** - Upload issues are common
‚ùå **Missing URLs** - Judges can't find your demo
‚ùå **Unlisted video** - Public videos risk DMCA claims on music

## Example Script Template

```
[INTRO - 30s]
"Hi, I'm [Name]. I built a Web3 deal discovery platform that reimagines
Groupon for the blockchain era. Imagine every discount as a transferable
NFT you can own, trade, or gift. Let me show you how it works."

[MERCHANT DEMO - 45s]
"First, merchants can create deals from this dashboard. I'll create a
90% off coffee deal. Upload an image, set the quantity, and click save.
Behind the scenes, an NFT collection is minted to the merchant's Solana
wallet. The entire process takes seconds."

[USER DEMO - 45s]
"Now as a user, I can browse deals on the marketplace. Let's claim this
coffee deal. One click, approve the transaction, and the NFT coupon is
now in my wallet. Here it is in My Coupons."

[REDEMPTION - 30s]
"When I'm ready to use it, I generate a QR code. The merchant scans it
with their redemption scanner, verifies the signature, and confirms.
The NFT burns on-chain, ensuring single-use and preventing fraud."

[FEATURES - 1min]
"But there's more. Users can review deals, vote on quality, and resell
unused coupons in our secondary marketplace. We've integrated real APIs‚Äî
over 1 million deals via RapidAPI. Users can stake NFTs for 12% APY
rewards. And everything is geolocated for local discovery."

[TECH STACK - 30s]
"Built on Solana with Anchor smart contracts. Next.js 15 frontend with
TypeScript. Supabase for off-chain data. Arweave for permanent storage.
MoonPay for payments. Real API integrations, not mocks."

[OUTRO - 30s]
"This platform makes Web3 invisible. Email login, no crypto jargon,
mobile-first design. Try the live demo at [URL]. Code is open source on
GitHub. Built for MonkeDAO's Cypherpunk Hackathon. Thank you!"
