## About MonkeDAO

MonkeDAO is a community that's all about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the Solana ecosystem. We're passionate about supporting innovative projects and fostering a vibrant builder environment. That's why we're excited to sponsor a track at the Cypherpunk hackathon that aims to build something truly ground-breaking.

---

## Mission

Build the next evolution of Groupon - but user-owned, borderless, and Web3-powered. Your challenge is to create a deal discovery platform where every promotion lives as a collectible, tradable NFT that grants real-world savings - from flights to shopping sprees. Build something that turns discounts into digital assets.

**Goal:**

Empower hackathon teams to build a **user-owned discount & rewards marketplace** that aggregates real-world deals - flights, hotels, restaurants, experiences, shopping - and wraps each promotion as a **transferable NFT** to enable verifiable ownership, resale, and cross-platform use.

---

## Core Problem Statement

Traditional discount platforms (like Groupon) rely on centralized databases and often trap users with non-transferable coupons. This sidetrack challenges teams to design a **trustless, transparent, and liquid deal economy** where:

- Promotions are **verifiable NFTs**
- Redemption can be tracked **on-chain**
- Ownership can be **transferred, traded, or gifted**
- Merchants retain control of **issuance & limits**
- Users can **discover, collect, and share** deals globally

---

## Hackathon Track Scope

We're looking for projects that tackle the core problem of traditional, non-transferable discount platforms by building a trustless, transparent, and liquid deal economy. Your project should address how promotions can be verifiable NFTs, how redemption can be tracked on-chain, and how ownership can be transferred, traded, or gifted, all while allowing merchants to maintain control of issuance and limits.

### Key Features to Consider

- **NFT Promotions / Coupons:** Each deal or coupon should be minted as a transferable NFT with detailed metadata (discount %, expiry, merchant ID, redemption rules). This introduces ownership, liquidity, and verifiability.

- **Merchant Dashboard:** Develop a user-friendly interface for merchants to easily create promotions (discounts, bundles, flash sales) that automatically mint NFT coupons.

- **User Wallet & Marketplace:** Users should be able to browse, purchase, or claim discount NFTs and have the option to re-list them for resale.

- **Deal Aggregator Feed:** Integrate with external APIs (like Skyscanner, Booking.com, Shopify) to populate live deals, creating a critical mass of offers.

- **Social Discovery Layer:** Incorporate features where users can share, rate, or comment on deals, fostering a community-driven virality similar to platforms like RedFlagDeals.

- **Redemption Verification Flow:** Implement a secure redemption process, such as QR code or on-chain signature-based verification by the merchant, ensuring single-use coupons.

- **Reward Staking / Cashback:** Consider adding an optional feature for staking NFTs for rewards or merchant tokens to incentivize long-term engagement.

---

## Web3 Integration Challenges to Address

- How will NFT coupons be represented, and which metadata standards will you use?
- What will the redemption flow look like? (Off-chain verification with on-chain attestation, or smart-contract-based logic?)
- How will you abstract Web3 elements to ensure a simple user experience for mainstream users? (e.g., wallet login, fiat payments, verification services)
- How can small businesses easily onboard and issue NFTs, potentially leveraging existing catalogs?
- How will you enable marketplaces for unused coupons to ensure liquidity and resale?

---

## Bonus Challenge Ideas

- Integrate on-chain reputation or loyalty levels using NFT badges for active users.
- Build a travel-specific subset focused on NFT/crypto event-based hotel or flight deals.
- Add geo-based discovery ("Deals near me") with on-chain verifiability.
- Partner with existing NFT marketplaces to resell unclaimed discounts.
- Enable group deals where users can pool resources to unlock tiered discounts.

---

## Submission Requirements

- A deployed application or a detailed prototype showcasing the features.
- Access to your GitHub repository with clear instructions on how to run your project.
- A short video (3-5 minutes) demonstrating the core functionality and user flow.
- A brief write-up explaining your design choices, technical implementation, and how you addressed the Web3 integration challenges.
- Your solution should either expose an API for integration or be designed in a way that allows easy integration into other applications.
- The submission must be made through Superteam Earn.

---

## Judging Criteria

- **Innovation and Creativity:** How novel and imaginative is your solution in leveraging Web3 technologies for a discount platform?
- **Technical Implementation:** The quality of your code, the robustness of your smart contracts (if applicable), and the overall technical architecture.
- **User Experience (UX):** The ease of use and intuitiveness of the platform for both merchants and users, especially in abstracting Web3 complexities.
- **Feasibility and Scalability:** The potential for your project to be adopted by real-world merchants and users.
- **Completeness:** How many of the key features and Web3 integration challenges were addressed in your submission.
